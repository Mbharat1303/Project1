        <h2>IMPORTANCE OF TREES</h2>
        <p>Trees play an especially important role in enhancing our quality of life in the urban environment and this is acknowledged in the Governments Sustainable Development Strategy. They screen unsightly structures and activities, give privacy and soften the hard lines of buildings. Trees also bring colour and contrasts into the urban environment. 

            Not only do trees have a visual quality, but they also enhance the environment in less obvious ways.
            
            Trees improve air quality by acting as natural air filters removing dust, smoke and fumes from the atmosphere by trapping them on their leaves, branches and trunks. Just 1 hectare of beech woodland can extract 4 tonnes of dust per year from the atmosphere.
            
            Trees reduce the 'Greenhouse' effect by removing carbon dioxide from the air and releasing oxygen. Each year a mature tree produces enough oxygen for 10 people.
            
            Trees are also an effective sound barrier and can limit noise pollution. Recent research shows that trees also help reduce the stress of modern life.
            
            Trees in themselves benefit the environment and the landscape, but they are also an integral part of the ecosystem providing benefits to wildlife and biodiversity. Trees, especially older or veteran trees and those in groups or woodlands, provide habitats for native ground flora such as bluebells and fauna, particularly bats, red squirrels and invertebrates.
            
            The planting of trees and the care and preservation of mature trees can go a long way to making Trafford a great place to live, work learn and relax.

        <h2>WAYS TO PROTECT THE NATURE</h2>      
            <p> Plant treesâ€”the more the better! </p>         
            <p>Use less paper</p>                  
            <p>Use organic fertilizers</p>                    
            <p>Painting of tree trunk with lime stone powder prevents the tree from infections</p>   
            <p>Prevent excess deforestation</p>
            <p>Minimize the use of disposable wood material</p>
            <p>Mandatory tree plantation</p>

        <h2>WHAT IS NATURE?</h2>      
           <P>Nature is the ultimate source of our living. Both living and non-living things include nature, and everyone is interdependent, which helps maintain the ecosystem. Plants, animals, and humans all depend on nature for their survival. It supplies oxygen, sunlight, soil, water, and other necessary components. But deforestation has been the primary cause of global warming, destroying nature. In addition to exploiting excessive natural resources, other industries pollute the environment with toxic gases and chemicals. It is now essential to reduce biological damage, reuse things, and recycle existing materials to create new ones. People from all over the world should join forces to relieve pressure on the environment and restore its balance. It is now the essential aim to serve nature with utmost care to save our nature from hazards and threats.</P>
